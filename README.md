# Programmable load base layer
The lowest level Yocto layer for the programmable load system image.

This provides stuff like device trees, hardware definitions, and bootloaders, as well as machine definitions.

## Dependencies
Other layers required to build the programmable load are:

- meta-openembedded: specifically, meta-oe and meta-filesystems
- meta-openamp
- meta-rauc

## Build configuration
First, select the distro `sativa` in your build configuration; then configure your `build/conf/local.conf` to use one of the following machines:

- stm32mp157a-dk1: STM32MP1 development board

Additionally, you may wish to enable additional image features for debugging:

```
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES = "debug-tweaks tools-debug"
```

Note that the flag to enable a read-only rootfs (`read-only-rootfs`) is not specified, as this causes some configuration (namely Dropbear) to get overridden such that the host key is _not_ stored on the overlay in /etc, and instead a ramdisk.
